**Disclaimer:** *This is not an official IBM github repository. This is a personal repository used for demo/workhsop purposes.*

This demo is intented to showcase IBM CF and walk you through the process of deploying a simple cloud-native application on the cloud. It also showcases some of the CF features like: self-healing & scaling. The dmeo app is a very basic calculator that can only divide two numbers and return the result through a web based UI. The app consists of two main components:

1. A ReactJS Frontend *(Located in the [calculator-ui folder](https://github.com/usfngm/cf_workshop/tree/master/calculator-ui))*
2. A NodeJS Backend  *(Located in the division-service folder)*
